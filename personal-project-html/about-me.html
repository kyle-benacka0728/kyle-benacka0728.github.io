                Like anyone, there's a decent bit of information to know about me. I did my best to compile
                my professsional history and personal enjoyments on the right as a brief summary, however, if you'd like to hear it from myself I'd
                be happy to oblige!<br>
                <br>
                My name is Kyle Benacka, I was born on July 28th, 2005 and I've moved around a lot of what I'd like to call the mid-midwest.
                I've lived across Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri with Iowa being the most recent place I've lived. Over all those locations I've gotten many Interests
                such as gaming, music making, and the unending thirst for knowledge! I'd say knowledge is one of the things I value most in myself, with it being the foundation
                of how my interests develop and what I do with said interests. For instance, I like video games, and while I do often just play games and enjoy them I also like to
                analyze the deeper meanings some have and on the more technical side of things I like to learn the coding that makes it all possible.<br>
                <br>
                On the more professional side of things I have a rather flushed out employment history for a person my age. I've worked for around four years so far, with over a year
                and a half being spent at my current workplace of Walmart. I've had to work to give myself the opportunity to go to college and that struggle helped me develop a solid 
                work ethic which I bring to the table everywhere I go, work or otherwise. I also know how to be sociable with everyone whether it's customers, coworkers, or managers I 
                always find a way to be charismatic!

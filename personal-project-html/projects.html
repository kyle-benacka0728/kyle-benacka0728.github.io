                    In my python class we did a final project over all the elements we had 
                    gone over in class like case structures, if statements, proper calcs, 
                    file writing and the like!

                    Back when I was in highschool for my final project in music theory I made a
                    video essay over one of my favorite games, Halo Reach!

                    In my computers class we dealt with many Office 365 apps, excel included, in which
                    I've learn't many skills like filtering, sorting, formatting and the like.

                    I have done brief forrays into game development and enjoy it even though college and 
                    work have caused me to lose time to do it.

                    Through my first term at college I've learnt and became more than proficient in 
                    pseudocode and find myself satisfied with my performance with it.
